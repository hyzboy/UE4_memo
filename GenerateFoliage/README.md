If you use this, change your project name "MYPROJECT2" in BPFL_GenerateFoliage.h <br>
And, you should add `PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Foliage" });` <br>

note: Need to exists foliage object in your world. if not exists foliage, your project is crushed.

Later, if I find out how to generate from 0, I will fix this.
